    <p class="text-2xl mt-12 md:mr-96">
        Based out of Pittsburgh, PA. I started programming as a hobby making small webpages for my school in 2016, and it has become my fulltime passion outside of work. Since 2019, I've had a focus on backend tech and native desktop apps, as well as leading a community of hundreds of developers and guiding others through the programming journey.
